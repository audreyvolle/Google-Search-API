# Google Search API

An attempt to get more familiar with Python.

## Summary 

The Google Search API is a Python library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for accessing Google's search functionality. With this library, developers can use the Python programming language to search for a specific query and retrieve the first result link. The library uses the popular requests module to make HTTP GET requests to Google's search page, and it parses the response using the BeautifulSoup module to extract the desired information.
